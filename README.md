## What's Next? 

Well, this is a school project, so it'll probably stay like this for a while. I see potention in this site more for buisness
wanting to share photos in other departments. For now, I'll leave it running and let people use it as they please. 

# Â¡Nota!
Files are stored in a way that the URL can be distrubted to anyone (That's probably the biggest fix I need to make). 
So don't put any sensitve photos.
